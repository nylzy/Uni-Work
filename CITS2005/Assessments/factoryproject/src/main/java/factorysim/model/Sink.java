 * Tockable: On every tock, the sink should pull all available 
 * items from any connected machine output sources 
 * StatResettable: The sink should be able to reset any data tracking statistics.
 * 
 * Project note: You should replace any empty methods with your implementation as indicated (YOUR CODE HERE). 
 * The comments clearly specify what each method should do. You might also find it useful to refer 
 * to the specification and SinkTest.java file for more details on the expected behaviour of the Sink class.
 * 
 * You may add your own fields and methods as you see fit, but you should not 
 * alter the method signatures of the provided public methods, or the tests will fail!
